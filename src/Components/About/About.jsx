            <h3>CODE OF CONDUCT</h3>
            <h2>OUR APPROACH</h2>
            
            <p>DFT focuses on developing the potential of marginalised women and girls to drive equitable changes through programmes which deliver quality healthcare, inclusive education, gender equitable and sustainable livelihood opportunities and disaster relief and preparedness.

Our Approach combines these like Humanitarian, Respect, Impact, Professional, Inclusive, Impartial, Professional etc.</p>
<p>We believe people affected by any social or medical can and should be empowered to contribute to relief, rehabilitation and development efforts.

Drishti Foundation Trust extended its thematic areas of intervention by supporting family health, livelihood and women empowerment. Children, their families and the community become the target group for DFT â€˜s activities as child education cannot be done in isolation and nothing else but education for children can bring long lasting change in the society.</p>
